# EthCommunities (Inactive ðŸš«)

Communities was a project that I started in an effort to learn and understand Ethereum Smart Contracts (with [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)) and interacting with a Blockchain as a decentralized backend service. 

The intention was to be a sort of "Social Network" in which access to community channels (groups) was controlled by holding [ERC-721 (Non-fungible) tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/). The intention of this being that the number of access cards to a group would be limited.

To see the Contracts created for this project, see here: [CommunityContracts](https://github.com/NickChubb/CommunityContracts).

## Final Progress

By the time I stopped working on this project, I had implemented several features and have a bare-bones example live on the Ropsten Test-Network.

### Features Implemented:
- Creating Community Access Tokens
- Created [ERC-20 (fungible)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) for each community, allowing each community to have its own "currency"
